# Okazanta

Okazanta is modern open source status page software that anyone can use to create a clean and accessible status page for any kind of services.

This project is a fork of the currently unmaintained [Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet) project.

Okazanta was created with two purposes.

1. To maintain, update, and modernise Cachet, squashing bugs, and updating security. 

2. To add realtime server and site status monitoring with automatic alerts and status page updates. 

Okazanta is released under the BSD-3 license [![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD3-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

## Okawhat?

The name (loosely) comes from the Esperanto word for occurrence or incident. Both of those words seem a good fit for an app that reports what is happening, the OK at the sart of the word implies a 'positive status check', and since the project is universal and open to all, why not a little bit of Esperanto :)

## Legacy?

The **Legacy** branch is an update to Cachet without major changes, it's bascially the old code with a few additions from other more updated forks, and will recieve essential security and stability fixes and other minimal updates. 

We will also be creating a new **Core** branch which will be based on Laravel 9 with all modern dependecies. There may be some breaking changes and it will not be ready for a while, but it will be the future of the Okazanta project. 

## Get involved

There is a huge amount to do, even to pull the existing code up to today before any other changes or steps forward, and we are happy for any help. 

Please DO start issues, comment on others, make PRs, and come and take part in discussion on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/4CtKuuHrqJ).
