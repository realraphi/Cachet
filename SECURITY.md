# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There has not been an official release of Okazanta-legacy yet, but we do want to hear about any vulnerabilities in the current codebase as it stands on GitHub. 

## Reporting Vulnerabilities 

If you find a vulnerability in Okanzanta-legacy (or any of our other repos) then please **DO NOT** dislose it publicly. 

To report a vulnerability, please make a submission on [Huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https://github.com/Okazanta/okazanta-legacy).
Their website should give you a good idea on how to make a good vulnerability report.
It's important to make the submission there as it keeps the vulnerability private which helps ensure it can't be exploited while a patch is in the works. 

If you have a suggestion that is related to security but not an actual exploit, then [creating an issue](https://github.com/Okazanta/okazanta-legacy/issues/new/choose) on GitHub is a suitable place.

Usually a good report should include which file(s) has the exploit, how the vulnerability could be exploited, the potential ramifications of the vulnerability, a proof of concept exploit, and if possible insight into a solution.

## Not a Vulnerability?
**Reporting bugs**
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Okazanta. 
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. 
When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

**Note:** If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Before Submitting A Bug Report
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
A detailed guide can be found here: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). However if you're still unsure or it's too much to read drop a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4CtKuuHrqJ). Sometimes it takes time to respond; please be patient!
